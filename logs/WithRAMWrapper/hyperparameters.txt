Toate modelele sunt antrenate pentru 10M de operatii
model1 { -> n_stack=4, n_skip=4 -> Perfect! Nota 11/10 -> A invatat doar dupa 4.8M de operatii cum sa joace bine
    learning_rate: linear_schedule(3e-4),
    n_steps: 2048,
    batch_size: 64,
    n_epochs: 10,
    gamma: 0.99,
    gae_lambda: 0.95,
    clip_range: 0.2,
    normalize_advantage: True,
    ent_coef: 0,
    vf_coef: 0.5,
    max_grad_norm: 0.5,
}

model1 -> world 1 stage 2 -> try 1 {
    same hyperparameters as before
    learns too fast and forgets to learn the first level too
}

model1 -> world 1 stage 2 -> try 2 {
    same hyperparameters as before but this time the learning_rate is linear_schedule(1e-4) for 5M operations
    It forgets and doesn't learn well
}
